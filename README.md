# gmail_fetch_mails
In this sample, which written in Python.

It try to fetch mails from gmail and through IMAP protocol, I personally believe it will also works for other imap support mail servers, make sure you enter the correct server and your mail user name/password for use it.

It also take care of encoding things for different encoding in emails, there have some debug lines inside this script, you may use it or list your folders and change it to whatever you want to fetch.

In the end, it will output a csv file which seperated with comma.
